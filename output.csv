We bear witness to the effects of our government’s inability to respond to the existential threats of climate and ecological emergency, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ravages of a long history of systemic racism. Facing these threats alone can be overwhelming. Extinction Rebellion (XR) is a mass movement that is bringing people together to avoid total climate breakdown. This talk will (a) lay out the climate science that drives our urgency to act and (b) describe how we use nonviolent direct action to demand change from government, corporations, and media. We welcome you if you want to just learn about the state of the earth’s climate. We will love you if you join Extinction Rebellion to fight for it. We need everyone, whether or not you are in a position to perform direct action yourself. Come to hear more about what humanity is facing in the next decade, what has to happen to prevent catastrophe, and to connect with others who are wrestling with these truths. You are not alone. Refreshments will be provided! Please register ahead for this event as capacity is limited. Covid -19 event policy: Please bring your mask (preferably a KN-95 or N-95). There will be extra masks provided at the venue, and we will be asking everybody to wear a mask.
