AgendaWednesday April 26, 2023 8:45-9:15am: Coffee Welcome and networking in the Business Pavilion 9:15-9:20: Welcome by Julia Halperin, Conference Chair9:20-10:35: Sustainability and the artworld: responsibly operating art businesses in the time of the climate crisis requires cross-sector collaboration in order to make meaningful shifts towards sustainable models. After a momentary pause in operations after 2020, the art world is back in full swing with a robust pace of art fairs, exhibitions, and travel. How can galleries, shippers, and insurers work together to advance commitments to climate action in the sector? Speakers: Laura Lupton (LHL Consulting & Barder), Jake Burgess (AXA XL), Ted MacLean (Crozier), Maureen Bray (ADAA)10:35-10:50: The Art Provenance Report: following a successful inaugural Art Provenance Symposium earlier this year, we present, The Report. An essential addition to the various yearly art market reports, the report addresses the state of due diligence and provenance research across the institutional and private sectors. During the Art Provenance Symposium, over 20 delegates offered their expert opinions on issues ranging from repatriation and restitution, new databases and research tools, case studies on a wide range of possible red flags and different approaches to provenance research, the current cultural heritage crisis in Ukraine, and the change in public perception throughout the decades. The Report contextualizes the main themes, emphasizing the key issues faced by art market professionals, independent researchers and curators. A steppingstone in the solidification of the relationship between the private and institutional culture sector, the reports aim is to broaden the conversation on ‘How much due diligence qualifies as duly diligent’ and ideally agree on a universal provenance standard. Presenter: Angelina Giovani (Flynn & Giovani Art Provenance Research)10:50-11:20: Coffee & Networking Break in the Business Pavilion 11:20-12:20: From Wallflower to Wealth Generator: how Art Lending unlocks value in an increasingly muddy landscape.

To help art owners navigate these options, the panelists will highlight the differences in underwriting guidelines of the various liquidity solutions. This all-women panel, moderated by Tim Schneider of Artnet News, will address the ways that the art lending space has evolved around the globe in the last decade. Topics will include creative ways that collectors, gallerists, estates, trustees, museums and others, are using art loans to meet their financial objectives and key challenges for both lenders and borrowers in the current market. Finally, the panel will discuss ways that the art financing landscape is likely to evolve in the coming years.
