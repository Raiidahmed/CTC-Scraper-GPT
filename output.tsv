FALSE	5/18/23 18:00	7:30 PM	Microsoft Technology Center 11 Times Square New York NY 10036	NYC	https://www.eventbrite.com/o/nyjavasig-2622223972	TRUE	"Today's traditional cryptographic algorithms and key exchange technologies will soon fall to quantum adversaries, whether using Grover's algorithm to whittle down symmetric keys or Shor's to overcome their asymmetric equivalents. As the price of storage plummets, vast amounts of encrypted data is already being stored with the knowledge it will be vulnerable within a short time frame. Data at rest has the longest duration and hence the greatest concern. Whether in financial services, health care, industry or government, the time to rethink existing cryptographic architecture is now.This presentation will explain the current landscape, covering existing and upcoming technologies that will undermine current algorithms. We will briefly explore the mathematical underpinnings of current implementations and see how quantum algorithms will shortly render these solutions susceptible to attack. Then, we will move to the draft NIST standards for a post-quantum (or at least far more quantum-resistant) set of proposals for how organizations can evolve and adapt, covering existing finalists for post-quantum implementations (and their recent hacks), as well as using quantum to defend against quantum, particularly in the realm of better entropy. Finally, we will present code examples and interactive demonstrations of the performance and strength of cutting-edge ciphers and how to integrate them into a Java environment to protect data in transit and in storage. Speaker: Sascha Goldsmith is a technologist with over 30 years of experience in various industries. With a law degree and a decade-long career in finance, he has always been passionate about security and privacy. Sascha's patented methods for private web browsing are revolutionary. He has led teams to deploy the first publicly facing Scala service at Amazon and owned the frameworks used by over 600 teams at Amazon for front-end and back-end applications. Sascha now serves as the CTO of Quantum Knight, where he develops the company's post-quantum set of cryptographic tools that operate at much higher key sizes and speeds than conventional symmetric ciphers."

An interracial intentional community, a Nation of Islam farm, the first community land trust, and a wave of cooperative experiments moving through the South in the late 1960s and 1970s found fertile ground around Albany, Georgia—a town that W. E. B. Du Bois called the “heart of the Black Belt.” But, reflecting solidarity between the civil rights, Pan-African, Nonaligned, and Tricontinental movements, associations with prominent international activists also linked this area in the US South to decolonizing efforts in the Global South just prior to a neoliberal turn. Within these networks, victims of White supremacy—best able to imagine its counter-logics within both local and international contexts—modeled approaches to survival that are now broadly relevant to today’s social and climate justice work. The story offers spatial tools and surprising histories to ground and energize a fresh wave of activism that looks to collective forms of urban and rural landholding to address racism, whiteness, inequality, reparations, and environment.“Trust Land” is presented as part of e-flux Architecture Lectures, a monthly series inviting researchers and practitioners to discuss timely issues in contemporary architecture, theory, culture, and technology.*Image: Consider the White-dominated middle of the United States —Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota. In this region, the nation’s strongest winds are underutilized for sustainable power, but, coupled with drought, they threaten another Dust Bowl. Politically-red states vote against big government even as they receive massive subsidies that outspend most government programs. Stretching from the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma to urban Minneapolis, where George Floyd was murdered, a sectional stack of data layers might map aquifer depletion, trade wars, crop monocultures, cattle ranches, feed lots, conservation areas, COVID cases, wind farms, earthquakes, fracking accidents, abuses against tribal peoples and lands, pipelines, bloated police budgets, food deserts, and farm subsidies—all in a tangle of cross purposes with ramifying global consequences.Keller Easterling is a writer, designer, and the Enid Storm Dwyer Professor of Architecture at Yale. Her books include Medium Design (Verso 2021), Extrastatecraft: The Power of Infrastructure Space (Verso, 2014), Subtraction (Sternberg, 2014), Enduring Innocence: Global Architecture and its Political Masquerades (MIT, 2005), and Organization Space: Landscapes, Highways and Houses in America (MIT, 1999). Easterling also co-authored (with Richard Prelinger) Call it Home, a laserdisc/DVD history of US suburbia from 1934-1960. Easterling lectures, publishes, and exhibits internationally. Her work appeared in the 2014 and 2018 Venice Biennales.

It aims to inspire a new economic mindset that prioritises social and environmental progress alongside traditional economic measures, exploring alternative metrics for measuring growth and progress, and considering natural capital as a vital asset in promoting sustainability and more inclusive approaches to progress. With our invited contributors and an inclusive meeting environment, we will explore how the advancement of technology can support a more sustainable and equitable future, challenging the traditional narrative of uncapped economic growth. We’ll examine the role of governments and businesses in developing and implementing technological measures and methods that support a more comprehensive and holistic approach to measuring economic growth and progress. This summit aims to inspire a new economic mindset that prioritises social and environmental progress alongside traditional economic measures, using innovative technological solutions. We will explore alternative technological metrics for measuring economic growth and progress, such as the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze social and environmental factors. By considering technology as a critical tool in economic growth, we can promote sustainability and encourage more inclusive and integrated methods of measuring progress. Through our discussions, we hope to generate new technological ideas and strategies that support a more sustainable and equitable future for all. To analyze how technology can be leveraged by governments and businesses to develop and implement measures and methods that support a more comprehensive and holistic approach to measuring economic growth and progress. To investigate the use of technology in measuring economic growth and progress, including the use of alternative metrics such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) and the Human Development Index (HDI), as well as the concept of natural capital. To identify opportunities for collaboration and partnership between governments, businesses, civil society, and other stakeholders in leveraging technology to drive a new era of prosperity that prioritises social and environmental progress. In what ways can technology support the integration of the concept of natural capital into traditional economic measures and promote sustainable economic growth? How can technology enable more comprehensive and holistic measurement of economic growth and progress, taking into account social and environmental factors alongside economic ones? What innovative technological solutions can governments and businesses adopt to promote sustainable economic development that prioritises social and environmental progress? As we explore the intersection of technology and sustainability, how can we ensure that technological innovations are used to address environmental challenges and promote social progress in a way that benefits all communities? What ethical considerations must be taken into account when using artificial intelligence to measure progress beyond traditional economic indicators, and how can we ensure equitable distribution of benefits? This summit is aimed at anyone interested in exploring the intersection of technology, sustainability, and economic growth. Attendees may include government officials, business leaders, academics, researchers, NGOs, and civil society organisations. The summit welcomes anyone with an interest in shaping a more sustainable and equitable future for all. By attending this summit, you will have the opportunity to engage with experts and thought leaders in the fields of sustainability, economic growth, and technology. You will learn about new approaches to measuring progress, including the concept of natural capital, and explore the potential of technology to drive sustainable development.

Cole recently created these works to address Newark’s dual environmental crisis of 2019: the lead contamination of drinking water in aging lead pipes and the opening of citywide centers to distribute water through thousands of single-use plastic bottles. While the water crisis exposed racialized health disparities in New Jersey by revealing which neighborhoods have and do not have access to safe water, the city’s sharing of thousands of cases of bottled water as a short-term solution further underscored our planet’s plastic problem. As a result of these crises, 15,000 of the city’s households were at risk for lead poisoning; meanwhile, the vast majority of plastics, including water bottles, are often made from toxic chemicals, particularly fossil fuels, that are harmful to all life. Difficult to recycle, plastics are responsible for 3.4 percent of our annual greenhouse gas emissions—they’re a major contributor to another ecological and social crisis: climate change. In order to draw our attention to these crises, Cole has for decades built a practice of transforming everyday objects—ironing boards, shoes, hair dryers, bicycle parts, and other discarded items—into art. By invoking what he calls a “primitive aesthetic on a modern object,” he applies the ancient craft of basket weaving to the 20th-century form of the plastic water bottle. As a result, his upcycling of these bottles awakens us to environmental threats while also demonstrating that art can disrupt these catastrophic cycles. As part of his 2022-2023 artist-in-residence at Express Newark, Cole—for the first time in his career—has invited community members into his artmaking process and his space (Express Newark transformed its Paul Robeson Gallery into his open studio for the year). Through this communal practice, and in the gathering thousands of used water bottles from throughout Newark to make his sculptures, Cole’s installations move our collective imagination beyond the reductive use of the singular bottle and into a deeper reflection of our precious resources and of what we can accomplish together as a community. A﻿bout the Artists W﻿illie ColeIn 2015, Cole’s work was included in “Represent: 200 Years of African American Art” at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and “Wild Noise: Artwork from the Bronx Museum of the Arts” at El Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Havana. In 2016, his work was included in “Disguise: Masks and Global African Art” at the Brooklyn Museum. “Willie Cole: On-Site” opened at the David C. Driskell Center, University of Maryland and traveled to the Museum of Art at the University of New Hampshire, and Arthur Ross Gallery, Philadelphia in 2016. The following year, Cole had solo exhibitions at the Snite Museum of Art at the University of Notre Dame and at the College of Architecture and Design Gallery at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. In 2019, “Willie Cole: Beauties” opened at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University as well as “Willie Cole: Bella Figura” at Alexander and Bonin, New York.Adrienne WheelerAdrienne Wheeler is a Newark, N.J. based visual artist, independent curator and artist educator at Paul Robeson Galleries, Express Newark, Rutgers University. She is the Lead Curator for Newark Arts Festival. Wheeler owned a brick and mortar gallery in NYC and continues to organize site specific exhibitions. Wheeler’s paternal family history spans 200 years in Newark, N.J. Her visual arts practice blurs the lines between spirituality, ancestry, oral history, and social engagement.
