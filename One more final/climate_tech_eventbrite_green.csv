For our next generation, they deserve better” - Jessica Sophia Wong / CEO and Founder of YorkseedEarth Day: Did You Know?The first Earth Day was celebrated in 1970 when a US senator organized a national demonstration to bring about awareness for environmental issues and by 1990, over 140 countries celebrated Earth day. The date was chosen to appeal to college students because it fell between spring break and final exams.The birth of Earth Day led to the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).According to the EPA, today’s average American generates about 4.5 pounds of trash per day, compared to 2.68 pounds in 1960!Global average temperature has increased about 1.8°F from 1901 to 2016 (psst - Even changes of one or two degrees can cause potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather!)Find out more information and interesting facts here: Earth Day Fact SheetsWhat Can We Do?We must all do our part in protecting our planet and make choices towards a sustainable future!

We need to preserve the beauty of the earth and its natural resources for future generations. My inspiration is to encourage people to recycle waste to protect oceans and forests. Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter the oceans. If no action is taken, plastic will increasingly impact our ecosystems, health, and economies. The idea of the painting is to capture the nature’s beauty: pure ocean, shiny hills, gorgeous sky….its endless beauty and bring awareness to the issues of maintaining clean air & water.Featured Artist: Natallia Vasian — up and coming artist who will be auctioning off Abstract landscape “The Purity of Life” (20”x24”) for the cause! Natallia graduated from School of Visual Arts and now creates mixed media abstract textured art paintings that speak to our souls. In the modern world full of disturbing events, anxiety and mental health issues, Natallia wanted to create the world of happiness and peace, this is when she discovered art - it helps to achieve emotional state in our minds, get distracted from reality, and find inner peace through art therapy.PRIMARY  — our generous venue sponsor for this event; provides coworking and shared office space featuring an array of amenities designed to help people feel good while working to make their businesses thrive!Sera Wines — for their generous supply of Ferraton Père et Fils, allowing us to taste the history and passion behind Ferraton’s wines through a selection of white, red, and rosé.Founded in 2016, Sera Wine Imports sources high quality wines from both renowned and emerging European winemakers and introduces them to the USA.

From their own birth, mothers contain all the eggs that they will ever have in life. We have been formed from unmeasurable time. Remembering or imagining a mother’s life and body is also to reflect on our own life and body, and beyond.” — Eiko Otake With the Dead is a place-inspired performance conceived and performed by acclaimed movement-based, interdisciplinary artist Eiko Otake. It is presented in conjunction with her installation in Green-Wood’s Historic Chapel, Mother. In it, through video and sculpture, Otake converses and dances with her mother who died in 2019. Beginning in the Historic Chapel and leading participants outdoors, the artist considers what the dead might want from the living and whether through performing she could practice as well as learn about her own dying.The dramaturg for With the Dead is Iris McCloughan.

Green-Wood’s official birding checklist will be made available to all attendees, or you can print it in advance here.And depending when you stop by, you may see a variety of different species passing through:Early Spring Migration (April)Our April tours will be a feast for the ears and eyes with the trilling song of pine warblers and drumming pronouncements of woodpeckers on newly blossoming trees (including magnolias, maples, quinces, and dogwoods). We’ll discover thousands of songbirds resting before their trip farther north as well as arriving herons and egrets at Green-Wood’s glacial ponds.Peak Spring Migration (May to mid-June)From ruby-throated hummingbirds to over twenty species of colorful wood warblers, our peak migration tours will feature many of the 163 bird species that have been recorded at Green-Wood during the month of May. Beginning just after sunrise, we will experience spring’s dawn chorus at the most active time of day for birds.Summer Birding (Late June to August)In July we should see the offspring of our resident red-tailed hawk bravely preparing to leave the nest. Warbler songs will be replaced by chirring cicadas and the tweets of fledgling birds. Butterflies and dragonflies are abundant. By late-July, expect the arrival of the first southbound migrants.Before Purchasing Your Ticket, Please Note:COVID-19 Policy: In accordance with New York State and CDC guidance, masks are optional.

Meier, longtime Green-Wood tour guide and author of the recently published Grave (2023), part of the Object Lessons series published by Bloomsbury.

Visitors will explore this complex history through the lens of Green-Wood, where grand mausoleums and Victorian statuary mingle with columbaria for cremated bodies and a new area that centers communal memorialization and green burial.Before Purchasing Your Ticket, Please Note:COVID-19 Policy: In accordance with New York State and CDC guidance, masks are optional.

Attended by me, her death was unhurried, and convincingly due.” — Eiko OtakeJoin us for a special evening with acclaimed movement-based, interdisciplinary artist Eiko Otake, whose latest Installation, Mother, is currently on view in the Historic Chapel. Having often explored themes of loss, Otake performed Two Grave Markers at Green-Wood in 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. She now returns with Mother, in which, through video and sculpture, she converses and dances with her mother who died in 2019.  Otake will be joined in conversation with Gabrielle Gatto, Green-Wood’s coordinator of public programs and a certified death doula, for a discussion about dying, death, loss, and grief. In particular, they will focus on the experience of witnessing the death of a loved one: the impact it has on our own lives and, in contrast, how violence deprives people not only of life but also of an unhurried death. This talk takes place in the Modern Chapel, and there will be an opportunity to view the installation in the Historic Chapel before and after. A reception will follow.Free. Registration required.

In the aftermath, we enter the strained relationship between Davis and his wife, Frances Taylor, whom he has recently cajoled into ending her run as a performer on Broadway and retiring from modern dance and ballet altogether. Frances, who is increasingly subject to Davis’ temper—fueled by both his professional envy and substance abuse—reckons with her upbringing in Christian Science and, through a fateful meeting with Lena Horne, the conflicting demands of motherhood and artistic vocation. Meanwhile, blowing off steam from his beating, Miles speeds across Manhattan in his sports car. Racing alongside him are recollections of a stony, young John Coltrane, a combative Charlie Parker and the stilted world of the Black middle class he’s left behind.J﻿oin us for a reading by the author and a conversation with Farah Jasmine Griffin and Brent Hayes Edwards.","Center for Jazz Studies, Columbia University","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/center-for-jazz-studies-columbia-university-29380247105"

The corrective ML is trained to emulate a time-dependent global reference by learning state-dependent ‘nudging tendencies’ of temperature, moisture and winds.  The reference can be a reanalysis (for present-climate simulation) or a finer-grid version of the same model that may be more trustworthy across a range of climates. The ML is interpreted as a correction to the combined physics parameterizations of the coarse-grid model.  Unlike in other emulation approaches, heat and moisture conservation are built in. We train the ML on global 25 km reference simulations in multiple climates, and separately on a year-long 3 km simulation, and apply it in 200 km coarse-grid simulations.  The ML reduces annual-mean land temperature and precipitation pattern biases by up to 50% and enhances weather forecast skill.Bio: Chris Bretherton directs a climate modeling group at AI2 in Seattle which uses machine learning trained on global storm-resolving model output and observational data to improve climate model simulations.  He is an Emeritus Professor of the Atmospheric Science and Applied Mathematics Departments at the University of Washington, where for 35 years he studied cloud formation and turbulence and improved their simulation in atmospheric models.  He is an American Meteorological Society Charney Award winner,  IPCC author, AMS and AGU Fellow, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.Learn More: LEAP CHRIS BRETHERTON (Allen Institute for AI [AI2])","LEAP Center","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/leap-center-45565168003"

Shih, and Jessica Stoller to celebrate the publication of Clay Pop, which documents the reinvention of ceramic sculpture by a new generation of artists.PLEASE NOTE: RSVP is encouraged. Seating is limited. Doors open at 5:30 pm. The conversation will begin promptly at 6:15 pm. Can't attend? Preorder your signed copy here.Clay Pop documents the reinvention of ceramic sculpture by a new generation of artists.

A medium that has often been characterized as more craft than art, clay is now an exciting platform for formal and conceptual innovation. Traditionally diverged from engagement with popular culture, clay is now adding a new dimension to Pop Art.

Paralleling current concerns in painting, many of the thirty-eight artists featured in Clay Pop are also exploring issues of gender, race, and identity, using clay in novel ways to engage with social issues. Artists are employing the medium to create a personal narrative, pushing clay beyond the confines of craft and design.

Much of the new work is exuberant and figurative, expanding on how the medium of clay has been traditionally used. Glazes are especially colorful, reflecting a range of influences that encompass vernacular commercial imagery and artistic sources from African American assemblage to Walt Disney. Funk art from 1970s Northern California is a source, as is the work of Pop artists like Claes Oldenburg. Some of the artists also draw on artistic influences from the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

Sections on each of the forty featured artists include a profile on their ceramic practice, images of their work, and a biography. The introduction describes the artists’ interconnected community while two longer essays place the work, mostly created in the past five years, in the context of the histories of Pop Art and ceramics.Alia Dahl joined Jeffrey Deitch in 2017 and is the Managing Director, Artists and Exhibitions.Dahl has curated and organized exhibitions such as Clay Pop (2021), Punch, curated by Nina Chanel Abney in both New York (2018) and Los Angeles (2019) and People in Los Angeles (2019) as well as special art fair presentations like Austin Lee: ❀✿✿✿❀ at The Armory Show (2020). Born and raised in Chicago, Dahl earned a BA in Art History from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a MA in Art Business at Sotheby’s Institute of Art in New York.Heidi Lau (b. 1987, Macau, China) lives and works in New York.

Selected solo and two person exhibition include Recent Sculpture, Matthew Brown, Los Angeles (2022); Empire Recast, Grand Lisboa Palace, Macao, China (2021); Spirit Vessels, Matthew Brown, Los Angeles (2020); Blood Echoes, AALA Gallery, Los Angeles (2019); The Sentinels, with Rachel Frank, Geary, New York (2018); The Primordial Molder, The Bronx Museum of the Arts, New York (2017); Third Rome, Deli Gallery, New York (2016); The Obscure Region II, Macau Art Museum, China (2014); and In the Garden, Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center & Botanical Garden, New York (2012).

Lau’s work has been exhibited in international institutions including the Museum of Arts and Design, New York; the Bronx Museum of the Art, New York; the Museum of Chinese in America, New York; BRIC, New York; and the Macau Museum of Art, among others.

Lau’s practice has been supported by numerous residencies and awards, including the Green-Wood Cemetery Residency, Greenwich House Pottery Fellowship, NYSCA/NYFA Artist Fellowship, Colene Brown Art Prize, Emerging Artist Fellowship at Socrates Sculpture Park, Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Process Space, the Martin Wong Foundation Scholarship, and the Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters and Sculptors Grant.

In 2019, Lau presented Apparition for the Macau-China Collateral Exhibition at the 58th Venice Biennale.Stephanie H. Shih’s painted ceramic sculptures explore the way cultural identities
 transform as they migrate with a diaspora. Her artwork is in the collections of the
 Syracuse University Art Museum and New-York Historical Society. Shih was a finalist
 for the Brooklyn Museum’s 2023 UOVO Prize and has had solo exhibitions at
 Berggruen Gallery (San Francisco), Syracuse University Art Museum, Harkawik (New
 York), NADA Miami, and Sebastian Gladstone (Los Angeles). Since 2017, she's raised
 over $110,000 for marginalized communities through her art and platform.Working in the realm of figurative sculpture, Jessica Stoller (b. 1981) mines the rich and complicated history of porcelain, harnessing its links to power, desire, and taste. Synthesizing the cultural, historical, and corporeal notions of the female body, Stoller expands the feminist visual vernacular and makes space for subversion, defiance, and play. For Stoller the ‘grotesque’ becomes a powerful tool to challenge patriarchal power structures, as female figures flaunt what they are told to hide, reveling in their own pleasure and abjection. Stoller lives and works in West New York, NJ. She received her BFA from the College for Creative Studies, and an MFA from Cranbrook Academy of Art. Her work has been included in exhibitions at the Cranbrook Art Museum, Bloomfield Hills, MI; UTA Artist Space, Los Angeles, CA; Jeffrey Deitch, New York, NY; Kavi Gupta, Chicago, IL; Anton Kern Gallery, New York, NY; Foundation Bernardaud, Limoges, France; and the Bronx Museum of the Arts, Bronx, NY, among others. She has had solo exhibitions at P·P·O·W, New York, NY; Hionas Gallery, New York, NY; and The Clay Studio, PA. A 2016 Pollock-Krasner grantee, 2013 Peter S. Reed grantee, and 2013 Louis C. Tiffany nominee, Stoller has also participated in residencies such as the Museum of Arts and Design’s Artist Studios Program, the Kohler Arts & Industry Program, and the Bronx Museum of the Arts’ Artist in the Marketplace Program, among others. P·P·O·W will present a two-person booth of new works by Stoller and Grace Carney at the Independent, New York, May 11 – 14.","Rizzoli Bookstore","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/rizzoli-bookstore-11785715523"

It is one of the main protagonists of our times. Its emergence as a rising power and its global ambitions have raised new challenges and urgent questions about its role in a changing international order and the future of that order. But are China’s behavior and significance adequately understood by the same concepts so frequently used to explain the experience of Western states? Concepts such as great power competition, empire, and the (new) Cold War have been used to explain China’s relationship with the world. To what extent do these concepts hold explanatory power, or do they reinforce unhelpful myths? This panel brings together scholars from different disciplines – political science, history, and sociology – to demythologize China, and to generate fresher ways to think about China in the world. The panel will explore both China’s domestic and international politics. It will discuss its political legacies of imperial state formation and transnational exchanges, including with other parts of the Global South, its view of the future of the international order, its increasing competition with the US and the space left for cooperation, Taiwan’s prospects, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of its own domestic political challenges.This event is sponsored by the Department of Political Science and the Anne & Bernard Spitzer Chair in International RelationsAbigail Coplin is an Assistant Professor of Sociology and Science, Technology, and Society at Vassar College. Her research analyzes the development of China’s biotechnology and agrobiotechnology industries to unpack how scientific innovation, business, and regime legitimacy co-evolve in the contemporary People’s Republic of China, how the Chinese state contends with scientific experts and incorporates expertise in its governance schemes, and how China’s pursuit of high-tech development is restructuring relationships among Chinese society, industry, and the party-state. She is currently completing a book manuscript entitled Domesticating Biotechnological Innovation: Science, Market, and the State in Post-Socialist China and a second project unpacking the sociopolitical mechanisms underpinning China’s model of biological data capitalism.Coplin holds a Ph.D. in Sociology from Columbia University, an M.A. in Regional Studies of East Asia from Harvard University, and a B.S. in Chemistry and East Asian studies from Yale University. She is currently a fellow in the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations’ Public Intellectuals Program, and has also previously held fellowships with the University of Pennsylvania Center for the Study of Contemporary China, the Yale Council on East Asian Studies, and the Fulbright Association.Naima Green-Riley is an instructor and incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Politics and the School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.

He has co-authored (with Victor H. Mair) Traditional China in Asian and World History (2012) and edited Buddhism Across Asia: Networks of Material, Cultural and Intellectual Exchange (2014). He is currently working on a book about Zheng He’s maritime expeditions in the early fifteenth century and co-editing (with Engseng Ho) the Cambridge History of the Indian Ocean, volume 1.He has done extensive research in India, China, Japan, and Singapore with grants from the American Institute of Indian Studies, the Japan Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation, National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (Singapore). He was the founding head of the Nalanda-Sriwijaya Center in Singapore and served on the Governing Board of the Nalanda University.Odd Arne Westad is a scholar of modern international and global history, with a specialization in the history of eastern Asia since the 18th century.  He studied history, philosophy, and modern languages at the University of Oslo before doing a graduate degree in US/international history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he primarily worked with Michael H. Hunt.  Westad has published sixteen books, most of which deal with twentieth century Asian and global history. In the first part of his career, Westad was mainly preoccupied with the history of the Cold War, China-Russia relations, and the history of the Chinese civil war and the Chinese Communist Party.  He published two monographs, Cold War and Revolution, which deals with US and Soviet intervention in the Chinese Civil War in 1944-1946, and Decisive Encounters, which is a general history of the Chinese civil war and the Communist victory in the period from 1946 to 1950.  He also edited several books on Sino-Soviet and Cold War history topics.Since the mid-2000s, Westad has been concerned with more general aspects of post-colonial and global history, as well as the modern history of China.  The three key works from this period are The Global Cold War, which argues for ways of understanding the Soviet-American conflict in light of late- and post-colonial change in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean; Restless Empire, which discusses broad trends in China’s international history since 1750; and The Cold War: A World History, which summarizes the origins, conduct, and results of the conflict on a global scale.Today Westad is mainly interested in researching histories of empire and imperialism, first and foremost in Asia, but also world-wide.  He is also trying to figure out how China’s late twentieth century economic reforms came into being and how their results changed the global economy. Westad joined the faculty at Yale after teaching at the London School of Economics, where he was School Professor of International History, and at Harvard University, where he was the S.T. Lee Professor of US-Asia Relations.  He is a fellow of the British Academy and of several other national academies.Raphaëlle Khan (MODERATOR) is an Assistant Professor at the City College of New York- CUNY. She is also an Associate at the Harvard Asia Center.Her work lies at the intersection of International History and International Relations. She focuses on the international politics of South Asia, both from a historical and a contemporary perspective, with particular interest in the role of decolonised states in shaping and contesting the world order in the 20th century, sovereignty and decolonization, and the foreign policy of emerging powers.She has published in Modern Asian Studies, The International History Review, and The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History. She has co-edited a volume titled Theorizing Indian Foreign Policy (Routledge, 2017) and has contributed to Human Rights, Empires, and Their Ends: The New History of Human Rights and Decolonization (Cambridge University Press, 2020).She was previously the South Asia Research Fellow at Institut de Recherche Stratégique (IRSEM) in Paris and a Visiting Fellow at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA) and at the Center for the Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania.Raphaëlle holds a Ph.D. from King’s College London and a double Master’s degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and the Institut d’Etudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po Paris).Larry Au (MODERATOR) is an Assistant Professor for the Sociology Department at The City College of New York's Colin Powell School. His research examines the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in the production of biomedical knowledge, and asks how clinicians and scientists can better serve their patients and the public. Part of this work examines the globalization of precision medicine—or the use of genomics and other forms of big data to improve diagnosis and treatment—as a policy idea and scientific project, focusing primarily on its rise in China. Another part of this research looks at the politics of expertise around Long Covid, in particular, the experience of patients as they navigate uncertainties around their condition.His work has been published in Sociological Forum, Qualitative Sociology, Social Science & Medicine, SSM-Qualitative Research in Health, Science Technology & Human Values, Science, Technology and Society, Public Understanding of Science, and other venues. This research has been supported by the Luce/ACLS Program in China Studies, the Social Science Research Council, and other funders.","The City College of New York","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/the-city-college-of-new-york-17921871030"

But perhaps even more crucial is the need for the next generation of technological innovation to solidify its long-term strategic partnership with a stakeholder that has in recent history, been largely ignored: nature. We’ll need  to spearhead cooperative efforts that minimize harmful impacts on the environment, and to develop new innovations that leverage nature’s time-tested strategies for how we actually build technologies and products. Estimates suggest that biologically-inspired innovation will grow to $425B by 2030.* By integrating nature’s 3.8 billion years of R&D into our portfolio, and investing in systems, processes, materials, and products that truly embed fundamental principles of efficiency, adaptivity, optimization, resiliency and regeneration, we can rethink how we design and build our future and catalyze new models to transform the way we live.You’ll discover the power of nature’s genius and how principles found in nature can be used to solve the most pressing challenges of our time.

Structures built with raw earth and no cement or synthetic stabilizers have the potential to minimize embodied energy and climate-change impacts. Earthen building processes—contemporary versions of ancient knowledge—are promising components of climate-friendly design that require further exploration and demonstration. Organized by Lola Ben-Alon of Columbia University GSAPP’s Natural Materials Lab with the support of 1014 and The Architectural League, this program gathers design practitioners, educators, policy advocates, and material scientists to explore the possibilities of earthen materials. The panel will discuss natural earth- and fiber-based building materials, their manual and digitally-driven fabrication, life cycles, and supply chains, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of using earthen materials in construction, renovation, and mass/insulation. The discussion will take place in connection with the exhibition Making with Earth, produced by the Columbia University GSAPP Making with Earth class at the Natural Materials Lab. Lola Ben-Alon is an assistant professor at Columbia University GSAPP, where she directs the Natural Materials Lab and the Building Technology curriculum. She specializes in earth- and bio-based building materials. Ben-Alon received her PhD from the School of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University. Her work has been exhibited at the Tallinn Architecture Biennale, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, and the Israel Museum, and published in Building and Environment, Journal of Green Building, and Automation in Construction. Lisa Morey is an engineer and architectural designer who owns and operates Colorado Earth, a company that produces adobe and earth blocks.

In-Person + Virtual Session from 2 PM to 5 PM Eastern, with a reception to follow. The Bard MBA in Sustainability is launching a new global certificate program focused on delivering worldwide education for enterprise solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges. The launch conference is scheduled for Thursday, April 20, and will be a hybrid New York City event with both in-person and virtual attendance enabled. After the conference, in-person guests are invited to a rooftop reception from 5 to 7pm. There is no cost to attend. Since 2020, Bard’s MBA in Sustainability has been piloting this approach, combining the scalability of an interactive, synchronous global classroom with high-touch engagement of local co-instructors. At the conference, faculty who are teaching in the program from Palestine, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, the US and other countries will focus on how to bring the power of the Global Certificate to your local university--- and to tens of thousands of students worldwide.The Certificate adapts three key courses from the Bard MBA for a global audience, graduate or undergraduate: Principles of Sustainable Enterprise; Social Entrepreneurship; and Leading Change in Organizations. While these all began as MBA courses, the Certificate program now provides a minor in social enterprise for all majors—from art and design to zoology. All three courses are centered around project-based learning, supported by close interaction with co-instructor faculty at the participating universities. The global collaboration is powered by RebelBase, an educational software platform built by Bard MBA entrepreneurship faculty member Alejandro Crawford and his team, and recently featured in the Stanford Social Innovation Review. You can watch the complete dialogue of faculty and student conversation about their experience in the Certificate global entrepreneurship course here.The Global Certificate is a project of the Graduate Programs in Sustainability at Bard College in New York, including MS and M Ed degrees, and the MBA in Sustainability, ranked the #1 Green MBA in the US by Princeton Review for 2021 and 2022.
