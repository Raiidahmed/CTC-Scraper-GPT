Lu PhD '18Sloan School Career Development Associate Professor MIT Sloan School of ManagementModerator:David E. WeinsteinDirector, Center on Japanese Economy and Business, Columbia Business School; Carl S. Shoup Professor of the Japanese Economy, Columbia UniversitySynopsis:Well-educated and prosperous, Asians are known as the “model minority” in the U.S. On average, Asians have the highest educational achievement, highest median income, lowest unemployment rate, and lowest crime rate. However, they appear disproportionately underrepresented in leadership positions, a phenomenon known as the “Bamboo Ceiling.” While there are various speculations about why this happens, the present research systematically investigates the science behind it.About the Speaker: Jackson G. Lu PhD '18 is the Sloan School Career Development Associate Professor in Work and Organization Studies at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He studies culture and globalization through two distinctive research streams. His first research stream examines the “Bamboo Ceiling” experienced by Asians despite their educational and economic achievements in the United States. His second research stream elucidates how multicultural experiences (e.g., working abroad, intercultural friendships) shape key organizational outcomes, including leadership, creativity, and ethics.Jackson has published in top general science journals (Nature Human Behaviour, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), management journals (Journal of Applied Psychology, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, Organization Science), and psychology journals (Annual Review of Psychology, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Psychological Science). His research has been featured in over 200 media outlets in different languages (e.g., BBC, The Economist, The Financial Times, Harvard Business Review, NPR, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, The Washington Post).He has received prestigious awards and honors, including 40 Best Business School Professors Under 40, 30 Thinkers to Watch, NLS Rising Star Award from the Academy of Management, Early Career Award from the International Association for Conflict Management, Rising Star Award from the Association for Psychological Science, and SAGE Early Career Trajectory Award from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology.

Business and Economic Development Post COVID-192. Re-Engineering Business Education in The New NormOverview of the ConferenceThe world of business is undergoing a time of considerable stress, change and in some sectors unprecedented growth. Much of the conventional wisdom concerning business education and theory is being challenged and thus it is all the more important to endeavour to elucidate what is taking place. Economic certainties look increasingly vulnerable and existing formulas appear jaded and in some cases moribund. Where once academics were fixated with global brands and multi-nationals increasingly the role of SMEs is coming to the fore. Governments from Armenia to Somaliland are keen to find ways to stimulate business and thus create local employment.Regrettably the global economic crisis is increasingly used as an excuse for poor performance at all levels thus limiting the search for routes out of it. It should not be seen as a destroyer but as a purifier, ensuring the survival and prosperity of the fittest. The business environment has changed and will be changing more than ever in years to come - some traditionally powerful markets have weakened while others have grown, cultural and geographical distances between people are shrinking, innovation in all aspects (technology, markets, finance, etc.) has become paramount for sustainable competitive advantage. The challenge of economic development is one faced by all nations and there is an extraordinary array of initiatives that are being put into place to act as ‘economic pump primers’. Whereas once developed markets would have only been interested in how other developed economies are stimulating economic development, increasingly there is interest in how developing economies are proving fertile nurseries for imaginative and often successful initiatives.

From her first LC position as a library clerk, it was through her area and language expertise -- combined with sheer determination -- that she essentially carved out her role as steward and champion of LC's long-neglected early TIbetan holdings which were based on the collections of three major scholars of Tibet and southwest China and acquired by LC in the early 1900s. Meinheit will talk about the early history of the collection; the growth of the collection through the PL-480 Books program with India, and achievements in bringing wider visibility of the Tibetan holdings through major cataloging and digitization initiatives.This event is part of the 2022-2023 lecture series on “Women in Tibetan Studies: A Lecture Series” and is sponsored by the Weatherhead East Asian Institute and C.V.

During the 22nd session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) in April, Grist Indigenous Affairs Editor Tristan Ahtone, joined by a panel of experts, journalists, and indigenous leaders, will explore the impact that fortress conservation efforts have on Indigenous populations around the world.

An essential addition to the various yearly art market reports, the report addresses the state of due diligence and provenance research across the institutional and private sectors. During the Art Provenance Symposium, over 20 delegates offered their expert opinions on issues ranging from repatriation and restitution, new databases and research tools, case studies on a wide range of possible red flags and different approaches to provenance research, the current cultural heritage crisis in Ukraine, and the change in public perception throughout the decades. The Report contextualizes the main themes, emphasizing the key issues faced by art market professionals, independent researchers and curators. A steppingstone in the solidification of the relationship between the private and institutional culture sector, the reports aim is to broaden the conversation on ‘How much due diligence qualifies as duly diligent’ and ideally agree on a universal provenance standard.

Taking place Monday, July 18 – Wednesday, July 20, this year’s conference “Maintaining Purpose” will take a wide-ranging look at the industry employing jewelry as a lens, while addressing what constitutes luxury in an age of responsible practice. In addition to considering the centrality of jewelry to culture and as historical document, we will discuss precious substances and their use, a broadened definition of natural resources to include cultural traditions and skills, new technologies, comparative approaches to extraction (for example, artisanal vs. larger-scale mining), the notion of premiums and what constitutes (and how to achieve) ethical sourcing and responsible practice—ranging from societal to environmental—and strategies for succession. The conference is highlighted by the participation of Silvia Furmanovich, Satta Maturi, and Pippa Small.Government, civil society, communities, and industry must preserve the magic, the romance, and emotional power of gold, diamonds, and jewelry for the consumer (while finding new ways to convey all of this) and, at the same time, do the hard work required to meet the imperatives of responsible sourcing and practice and environmental and social awareness, all of which underpin the UN's SDGs and the outcomes of COP 26.

The mission of NATC is to bring tobacco harm reduction to the international policy stage as the world moves towards health improvement, sensible regulatory frameworks, and away from combustion tobacco.  Specifically, this conference was created on the premise that Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) and other novel nicotine products can save lives by converting combustion cigarette smokers to a reduced risk delivery platform. This switch could reduce 8 million premature deaths globally and save up to one billion lives this century that otherwise will end early due to tobacco use.   By combining perspectives of public governance, private industry, and finance, the New Approaches to Tobacco Control Conference aims to address several of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The achievement of  SDG 3.4, (reduction of non-communicable disease deaths) is unattainable unless adult smokers are supported to quit or switch to reduced risk nicotine products. In addition, SDGs related to hunger (2),  gender (5), industry innovation (9),inequalities (10), climate action (13), deforestation (15) and partnerships (17) will benefit from accelerated efforts to end smoking. Tickets for New Approaches to Tobacco Control include admission to a combined networking cocktail-hour and research poster exposition.  We are currently accepting abstracts for submission.

In today’s corporate world, ESG is no longer an afterthought – it’s the norm. Companies are now expected to transparently disclose their impacts on the environment, employees, customers, and society at large, and use their ESG narratives as a catalyst for internal change, innovation, and brand enhancement.The tide has turned for socially responsible investing, and the numbers speak for themselves. The assets invested in socially responsible investment products have seen a meteoric rise, and this trend shows no sign of slowing down. In fact, approximately one-fourth of all global assets under management, totalling over USD 23 trillion, are now being invested with a conscious consideration of environmental, social, and governance influences. This seismic shift has brought about a change in reporting practices, with most global organizations already disclosing their ESG information using established standards and frameworks. However, despite this progress, it’s clear that companies are still at varying stages of their ESG reporting journey, and there’s still much work to be done to ensure a sustainable and equitable future for all.As a professional looking to stay ahead of the curve and make a positive impact in your organization, the ESG Masterclass program is a must. Our program provides a comprehensive overview of the key concepts and practices of ESG, covering topics such as climate change, social responsibility, human rights, corporate governance, and sustainable investing. Our expert instructors will guide you through hands-on exercises and real-world case studies, giving you a solid understanding of ESG best practices.Upon completion of the course, you will be well-equipped to integrate ESG considerations into your work, identify ESG risks and opportunities, and develop strategies to address them. Whether you are an investor, a business leader, or a sustainability professional, this program is the perfect opportunity to enhance your professional development and take your career to the next level.  Join us for the ESG Masterclass program and start making a difference in your organization and the world.Enroll today to stay ahead of the curve and drive positive change.Key Learning FeaturesDevelop a deep understanding of ESG regulations and reporting/disclosure requirements and how to ensure compliance with them.Understand how ESG is changing business, moving markets, and driving regulation, and how to leverage this to create a positive impact in your organization.Explore the challenges and opportunities of ESG in 2023 and beyond, and how to stay ahead of the curve in this rapidly evolving landscape.Gain a comprehensive understanding of ESG in trade finance, and how to incorporate ESG considerations into financing decisions.Learn how to monitor and audit sustainability efforts in your organization, and identify opportunities for improvement and optimization.Understand what sustainable investing looks like across different asset classes, and how to evaluate ESG considerations in investment decisions.Explore ESG sustainable financial instruments, including green bonds and other innovative financing mechanisms, and how they can be used to drive positive impact.Gain a deep understanding of ESG bonds and green bonds, including how they work, how to evaluate their impact, and how to incorporate them into financing decisions.Understand the UN Sustainable Stock Exchanges’ Model Guidance on Climate Disclosure, TCFD recommendations, ISSB draft standards, and also regulatory changes in some countries.W﻿ho should attend?F﻿or AllF﻿eeThe fee for this course is G﻿BP3,200 per person.R﻿egistrationTo secure your spot in the program at GBP3,200 per person, please follow the link below to complete the booking process via the Shasat website: GID 41006 – ESG Masterclass (3 Days): 3-5 May 2023 @ New York CityProgram InstructorShasat Faculty MemberC﻿PD/ CPE3 DaysEarn Professional CertificateUpon successful completion of the training course, each participant will receive a certificate of completion that attests to the number of hours spent in training and serves as a valuable representation of their dedication to professional development.

But perhaps even more crucial is the need for the next generation of technological innovation to solidify its long-term strategic partnership with a stakeholder that has in recent history, been largely ignored: nature. We’ll need  to spearhead cooperative efforts that minimize harmful impacts on the environment, and to develop new innovations that leverage nature’s time-tested strategies for how we actually build technologies and products. Estimates suggest that biologically-inspired innovation will grow to $425B by 2030.* By integrating nature’s 3.8 billion years of R&D into our portfolio, and investing in systems, processes, materials, and products that truly embed fundamental principles of efficiency, adaptivity, optimization, resiliency and regeneration, we can rethink how we design and build our future and catalyze new models to transform the way we live.You’ll discover the power of nature’s genius and how principles found in nature can be used to solve the most pressing challenges of our time. Learn how to think, design, and innovate like nature does, and unearth 3.8 billion years of Earth’s evolutionary intelligence. T﻿here will be a nature walk to discover natural models in Greenwood Cemetery, during session 1 , but we will be meeting at Genspace. In this workshop, you’ll learn:what biomimicry is all about and how it relates to various industries.the biomimicry design process.how to approach problems through the lens of natural principles.how to start doing biomimicry research and  learn about the resources you can use.how to brainstorm, draw, and evaluate biological strategies and design ideas aimed at solving climate-related challenges.*Bioinspiration: An Economic Progress Report COVID-19 Safety Notice: Participants age 5+ must show proof of full vaccination (we recommend using the Excelsior Pass).

Comparably, the American Progress Report explained, since the pandemic, women have lost a net of 5.4 million jobs as opposed to men losing 4.4 million jobs. This is why the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp was created by Dr. Kyla (Dr. K), to help women rebuild, recover, get restored, and prosper, economically.   During the pandemic (COVID-19), many individuals have experienced a strain on their finances, including waiting endlessly for governments relief packages?  Layoffs, furloughs, and work hour reductions have occurred around the globe.  As a result, people are looking for alternatives to keep streams of income coming into their households.  Is this you?  Or maybe you need extra income in general, to pay for household, family, emergency, medical, educational, or other expenses.  If so, it may be time for you to consider starting a BUSINESS (online). Particularly, for home-based business, in the United States of America, home-based businesses (business owners) have access to 475-tax deductions, as opposed to the 3-6 tax deductions employees are given.Dr. K is a survivor of homelessness, domestic violence, and familial abuse while gaining academic degrees and building global corporations as a way out of and to overcome adversity, including economic recessions.

The seminars will examine real-world challenges facing cities and urban environments around the world, with topics ranging from citizen and social sciences to smart infrastructure.Engineering Electro-organic Reactions for Sustainable Chemical ManufacturingThe chemical industry produces more than 70,000 products (1.2 billion tons in total) via thermal processes powered by fossil fuel combustion, accounting for ~5% of the US energy utilization and >30% of the US energy-derived industrial CO2 emissions. Amongst these processes, the production of organic chemical commodities accounts for most of the energy utilization (>1200 TBTU/y), and the electrification of these processes via the implementation of electro-organic reactions could enable the integration of renewable electricity sources with chemical plants and accelerate the decarbonization of the chemical industry. Currently, however, two major challenges prevent the deployment of electro-organic reactions at scale: their low selectivity and their low production rates. To circumvent these barriers, Miguel Modestino's group combines electrochemical reaction engineering principles and machine-learning methods to accelerate the development of high-performing electro-organic reaction processes.  In this presentation, Professor Modestino will discuss his work on understanding and improving the production of adiponitrile (ADN), a precursor to Nylon 6,6, via the electrohydrodimerization of acrylonitrile (AN). This is the largest and most successful electro-organic reaction deployed in industry and serves as a test case for the development of large-scale organic electrochemical processes. His investigations on ADN are aimed at uncovering the relationship between the electrochemical environment at and near the electrical double layer (EDL) and reaction performance metrics (i.e., selectivity, efficiency, and productivity). He will discuss general guidelines for electrolyte formulation and provide insights into the role of different electrolyte species (e.g., buffer ions, chelating ions, selectivity-directing ions, and supporting ions) in achieving conversions of AN to ADN with selectivity as high as 83%. He will also present how carefully controlling pulsed electrosynthesis conditions guided by active machine learning can help mitigate mass transport limitations, control the concentration of AN near the EDL and enhance the production rate of ADN by >30%. Our learnings on ADN electrosynthesis helped us to also engineer the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of ADN to hexamethylenediamine (a Nylon 6,6 monomer), achieving the highest reported selectivity to date for this reaction (>95%). To further accelerate the development of high-performing electro-organic processes, his group has recently developed new machine-learning methods for rapid reactor outflow analysis using inexpensive spectroscopic tools and Bayesian optimization methods that leverage physical models to maximize process performance. These new tools are critical components of future autonomous workflows that will help us accelerate the electrification of petrochemical processes with large carbon footprints.About the Speaker Miguel A. Modestino is the Director of the Sustainable Engineering Initiative and the Donald F. Othmer Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering at New York University (NYU). Miguel obtained his B.S in Chemical Engineering (2007) and M.S. in Chemical Engineering Practice (2008) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley (2013). From 2013-2016, he was a post-doctoral researcher at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland where he served as project manager for the Solar Hydrogen Integrated Nano-electrolysis (SHINE) project. He is a winner of the Global Change Award from the H&M Foundation (2016), the MIT Technology Review Innovators Under 35 Award in Latin America (2017) and Globally (2020), the ACS Petroleum Research Fund Doctoral New Investigator Award (2018), the NSF CAREER Award (2019), the Inaugural NYU Tandon Junior Faculty Research Award (2020), and TED Idea Search Latin America (2021). His research group at NYU focusses on the development of electrochemical technologies for the incorporation of renewable energy into chemical manufacturing.

Given their significance in our city's landscape, it's no wonder that the design of streetscapes has a tangible and measurable impact on the well-being of New Yorkers. The designers, planners, and caretakers of the public realm, in partnership with community-based organizations, have developed a wide range of interventions to improve our city's physical, mental, community, and environmental health. These projects, ranging from temporarily pedestrianizing streets to redesigning corridors for multimodal transport, can be seen in residential, commercial, and industrial areas, as well as in parkland, throughout the five boroughs.  Designing New York: Streetscapes for Wellness serves as a source of inspiration for policymakers, practitioners, and community advocates seeking to reimagine streets and promote public health. In celebration of this remarkable publication, Open House New York is kicking off its Public Policy Talks series with Learning from Streetscapes for Wellness.

Tailored for the general public, these discussions will demystify how the city functions and who it serves. The aim is to break down what may seem like complicated policy measures for broad audiences and to help residents understand the current administration’s priorities. Above all, these talks will illuminate how public sector investments in the physical realm are improving the city’s resilience, cultural vitality, social cohesion, and economic opportunity. The Public Design Commission (PDC) is New York City’s design review agency, and has jurisdiction over permanent structures, landscape architecture, and art proposed on or over City-owned property. The mission of the PDC is to advocate for innovative, sustainable, and equitable design of public spaces and civic structures, with a goal of improving the public realm and therefore related services for all New Yorkers throughout the five boroughs.","Open House New York","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/open-house-new-york-1513263208"

It is established now that teaching mother tongue along with national language leads to enhanced intelligence among children. It is also acknowledged that appropriately sensitive education for children with different neuroabilities and raising community awareness about neurodiversity helps in better integration of these children within communities and improves their opportunities in life. Further it is evident from the success of some countries that where multiple national communities exist within a State, a plural approach to language, education and even constitutional arrangement reduces tensions and better coexistence.Educational systems should try to develop pluriversal and cross-cultural epistemologies for educating diverse populations as population numbers not only grow but populations become diverse. The event will look at a plurinational model, the advantages of mother tongue education, the methods of integrating neurodiverse children and the idea of ‘unconditional humanities’ where children start to think beyond individual communities or cultural boundaries.Join on Zoom with meeting ID: 871 8621 3293 & Passcode: 940415 or just scan the QR code below¡For in-person participation, please confirm your presence by sending your name and surname to ivan.shrg@proton.me.Deadline: Monday, 10th of April, 13:00 EST These details will be communicated to the building security team to grant you access to the venue.Agenda1:15 PM - 1:20 PM IntroductionIvan Lorenci de Francisco1:20 PM - 1:33 PM Decolonising Educational SystemsProf.  Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair1:33 PM - 1:46 PM Let's celebrate and educate truly global wisdomProf. Darryl Macer1:46 PM - 1:56 PM Prof. Renata M.
