He believes that an energy-aware perspective is imperative for developing true artificial intelligence and that an AI-first approach is imperative for solving the challenge of transitioning to a sustainable future based on renewable energy. Up until today, the primary focus of research on AI methods has been on predictive accuracy and its dependence on the amount of training data rather than the amount of energy that is necessary. However, going forward, data is (typically) abundant for many tasks but energy is becoming a limiting and economical factor. Not being energy-efficient in AI algorithms is not sustainable in the long term, in particular as the amount and dependence on AI methods in people’s life is only going to increase while the amount of energy that is available to society remains constant.","Hasso Plattner Institute New York","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/hasso-plattner-institute-new-york-25825239033"

Tech builders — designers, product managers and engineers — and experts participate in workshops, create teams, and work directly alongside the community to design and build new products and services.Fellows spend two months doing intensive, community-centric research to scope and define potential solutions. They then have another two months to build, test, and launch their ideas. Past Fellows have built venture-backed companies, tech-enabled nonprofits, open source projects, and more.We’re looking for potential Fellows who are ruthlessly dedicated to addressing the most pressing issues for low-income communities in NYC, both getting an idea off the ground and sustaining it long-term.Come join us to learn about the Blue Ridge Lab's (BRL) Fellowship Program.

Can epistemologies and practices built out of violence ever be remade towards justice? Does technoscience have a role in remaking our worlds out of the long aftermath?  Professor M. Murphy takes up a more than pessimistic and less than optimistic posture towards developing tactics for engaging the politics of technoscience. With Indigenous feminisms and queer leanings, Murphy draws out place-based tactics from environmental justice on Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee territories to navigate towards an Indigenous feminist anti-colonial politics with and against technoscience for the F/ISTS Keynote and Silver Science Lecture, ""With and Against Technoscience in the Aftermath.""About F/ISTSThe inaugural Feminist/Intersectional Science and Technology Studies Conference (F/ISTS) homes in on the reciprocal relations between techno-scientific knowledge and practices, on the one hand, and gender, race, class, and other intersecting axes of power, on the other. The interplay among technical and social dimensions of science, technology, and medicine is central to addressing many of the most pressing problems of our times, such as climate justice and environmental racism, health disparities, digital surveillance, and the growing mistrust in “science” as a domain of authority.About M MurphyM Murphy is a Professor of History and Women and Gender Studies at the University of Toronto, where they hold a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Science & Technology Studies and Environmental Data Justice at the University of Toronto. Their research is concerned with feminist, decolonial, and queer approaches to environmental justice, reproduction, Indigenous science and technology studies, transecologies, and data studies. They are Co-Director of the Technoscience Research Unit, as well as direct an Indigenous lab focused on environmental data justice. They are the author of The Economization of Life (2017), Seizing the Means of Reproduction (2012), and Sick Building Syndrome and the Politics of Uncertainty (2006), all with Duke University Press. Murphy’s current research concerns relationships between chemical pollution, colonialism, and technoscience on the lower Great Lakes, as well as the question of whether AI can be collaborated with towards Indigenous and anti-racist futures.

We leverage administrative data collected in deployment to design an online policy that maximizes mean outcomes while satisfying budget and fairness requirements. We propose a policy in which an individual receives the resource maximizing the difference between their mean treatment outcomes and the resource bid price, or roughly the opportunity cost of using a resource. Our approach has nice asymptotic guarantees and is easily interpretable. We show results on real data from the Homeless Management Information System in LA: our policies improve rates of exit from homelessness by 1.2% and policies that are fair in either allocation or outcomes by race come at very low price of fairness. In addition, to help guide the discussion among stakeholders in deciding on appropriate fairness requirements to impose when allocating scarce resources,  we propose a framework for evaluating fairness in such resource allocation systems and present a set of incompatibility results that investigate the interplay between them. Notably, we show that 1) fairness in allocation and fairness in outcomes are usually incompatible; 2) policies that prioritize based on a vulnerability score will usually result in unequal outcomes across groups; and 3) policies using group membership in addition to baseline risk and treatment effects are as fair as possible given all available information.BIOPhebe Vayanos is a WiSE Gabilan Assistant Professor of Industrial & Systems Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Southern California.

As the next expansion of our events platform, we are thrilled to introduce our inaugural Wavelengths Summit — our flagship conference on what’s next in music and tech, which will take place on May 6, 2023 in Bushwick, Brooklyn.Our thesisOur mission as an organization is to make the music industry more innovative, cooperative, and transparent. We accomplish this through a social, peer-to-peer approach to sharing knowledge and best practices for industry innovation.The Wavelengths Summit will be an IRL extension of this mission — fostering community among the next generation of music-tech leaders, creators, and innovators through culture, conversation, and collaboration.In a noisy tech landscape, we see more demand from music-industry professionals for a more focused environment to build community, exchange ideas, and bring new products to life. With emerging tech trends in particular, there’s a critical need for a forum that bridges the early-adopter perspective with a clear pulse on traditional industry needs, to establish a shared understanding of the issues at stake.The experienceWHO: The inaugural Wavelengths Summit is for artists, founders, dealmakers, and innovators — within the Water & Music Community, or yet to be a part of it.WHERE: Our inaugural summit will call Brooklyn home — more specifically, Bushwick, a mainstay  center for culture, music, and technology for New York City, and in turn for the world. It is home to iconic venues like Elsewhere, Brooklyn Mirage, Nowadays, House of Yes, and more.WHAT: The Wavelengths Summit will focus on what we feel we do best at Water & Music: Creating space for thoughtful discussion, community-building and experimental collaboration. Instead of panels, we will design the summit around more interactive, multi-way programming that showcases the experience and ingenuity of our members — with a focus on ROUNDTABLES, WORKSHOPS and DEBATES.We are honing in on three overarching themes and topics for the Summit. We see each of these broader topics as important interests and priorities for our community, and for the broader music-tech industry at large. Programming will be distributed evenly among these topics.Emerging Tech (e.c. AI, Web3, Metaverse)Fandom + Community (e.c. Artists + fans, DAOs)Bridging Legacy Systems (i.g. streaming, music rights)We are also excited to be partnering with Refraction for Cultural Programming – stay tuned for more details!Frequently asked questionsIs there a refund policy for registration fees?What is the schedule for the day?Is there a hotel or accommodation near the conference venue?Will Wavelengths Summit be live-streamed or recorded for later viewing?","Water & Music","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/water-amp-music-62205027333"

The talk will center on the recently published A History of Irish Literature and the Environment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2022). From Gaelic annals and medieval poetry to contemporary Irish literature, A History of Irish Literature and the Environment examines the connections between the Irish environment and Irish literary culture. Tackling themes such as Ireland’s island ecology, the ecological history of colonial-era plantation and deforestation, the Great Famine, cultural attitudes towards animals and towards the land, the postcolonial politics of food and energy generation, and the Covid-19 pandemic. Sen will demonstrate how these factors not only guide us to fresh perspectives on Irish literature but also provide pathways to imagine habitable futures at a time of climate collapse.  

Malcolm Sen is an Associate Professor at UMass Amherst and directs the Environmental Humanities specialization offered by the Department of English. His research focuses on questions of sovereignty, migration, and race as they emerge in climate change discourse. His literary archive spans global Anglophone, Indian, and Irish literatures.

He is the editor of The History of Irish Literature and the Environment (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2022); and Race in Irish Literature and Culture (with Julie McCormick Weng) to be published by Cambridge University Press in 2023. Sen’s monograph Unnatural Disasters: Irish Literature, Climate Change and Sovereignty is under review. Recent articles include “An Ordinary Crisis: Covid-19 and Irish Studies” in Mike Cronin et al., Eds., A Handbook of Irish Studies (Routledge, 2021) and “Sovereignty at the Margins: The Oceanic Future of the Subaltern,” in Barbara Haberkamp-Schmidt, Ed., Representing Poverty and Precarity in a Postcolonial World (Amsterdam: Brill, 2022), and “Joyce and Race in the Twenty-First Century” in Catherine Flynn, Ed., The New Joyce Studies: Twenty-First Century Critical Revisions (Cambridge University Press, 2022).

This event will explicitly draw out the connection between racial and environmental justice, how these lenses intersect with our food systems, and ultimately the role of food justice and sovereignty in the New York City food shed. We hope to invite students, food systems practitioners, and other members of the NYU community to interrogate and reflect on the systemic, institutional, and personal relationships we have with food and better align them towards the goal of racial and environmental justice.We’ll have food, student speakers, and a moderated panel discussion featuring food systems practitioners that are exploring and working within the different contours of the existing system and bravely exploring alternatives that aim to arrive at democratic, just, and equitable solutions. We’re inviting urban and rural farmers, producers and distributors, researchers, health practitioners, and consumers that all make up the different facets of a robust and dynamic food system to explore the various levers inside and outside of the systems we have inherited to join in a dynamic conversation.Catskills Agrarian Alliance (CAA) is a comprehensive food sovereignty project built from the ground up in Delaware, Otsego, and Schoharie Counties in New York State. We are regenerative farmers growing food and community to create and sustain a resilient food system capable of feeding us all.

SexCultureCrypto will explore what the future of sex, culture, and technology looks like within the crypto and NFTs.My passion for blockchain technology began in 2021 when I realized how crypto and NFTs could revolutionize sextech. I began to be very vocal about sextech in conversations around crypto and NFTs. I see crypto as a solution to the banking discrimination from centralized institutions because of any business related to the sex industry is seen as a VICE interest. We need a new definition of adult businesses and content. I see NFTs as an opportunity to navigate consent within our creative work and the utility of how it will be used to innovate sextech. SexTech has a trust management problem to manage with the current web2 /centralized system I produced, directed, and hosted the first-ever SexTech Crypto event. Every event I host has an ethos of empathy. Sexual freedom cannot be based on the morality of the current Web2 leaders to run and control the current platforms like Facebook. We need to look to Web3 and the decentralization of applications and elimination of censorship to create safer and more welcoming communities. Through these discussions and community, we can collectively break the 4th wall between innovation, compassion, and motivation with industry leaders.","SX NOIR","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/sx-noir-63053888053"

The corrective ML is trained to emulate a time-dependent global reference by learning state-dependent ‘nudging tendencies’ of temperature, moisture and winds.  The reference can be a reanalysis (for present-climate simulation) or a finer-grid version of the same model that may be more trustworthy across a range of climates. The ML is interpreted as a correction to the combined physics parameterizations of the coarse-grid model.  Unlike in other emulation approaches, heat and moisture conservation are built in. We train the ML on global 25 km reference simulations in multiple climates, and separately on a year-long 3 km simulation, and apply it in 200 km coarse-grid simulations.  The ML reduces annual-mean land temperature and precipitation pattern biases by up to 50% and enhances weather forecast skill.Bio: Chris Bretherton directs a climate modeling group at AI2 in Seattle which uses machine learning trained on global storm-resolving model output and observational data to improve climate model simulations.  He is an Emeritus Professor of the Atmospheric Science and Applied Mathematics Departments at the University of Washington, where for 35 years he studied cloud formation and turbulence and improved their simulation in atmospheric models.  He is an American Meteorological Society Charney Award winner,  IPCC author, AMS and AGU Fellow, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.Learn More: LEAP CHRIS BRETHERTON (Allen Institute for AI [AI2])","LEAP Center","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/leap-center-45565168003"

It aims to bring together scientists and social scientists to help look through the lens of historical pasts, politics, and embedded presents. Devastation and displacement from water caused by the climate crisis are and will remain a recurring, returning, and pervasive phenomenon in the global south. This approach intends to shift away from the focus on modeling catastrophic futures, the periodization of eras, and mapping the implications of climate change that prevail in current dialogues on climate change. Rather, the workshop guides towards a conversation that foregrounds human and environmental vulnerability in non-Western, transnational spaces with Indigenous and historical means of resilience. The intention is to continue this series with a focus on Air and Land in the following academic year.Event SpeakersSunil Amrith, Renu and Anand Dhawan Professor of History at Yale UniversityAmita Baviskar, Professor of Environmental Studies and Sociology and Anthropology at Ashoka UniversityKarine Gagné, Associate Professor of Sociology and Anthropology at the University of GuelphMaira Hayat, Assistant Professor of Environment and Peace Studies at the University of Notre DameMarvi Mazhar, architect and researcherMadeeha Merchant, architectHung T.

The Digital Giants have become a source of global concern, both because of their market power and the “digital harms” to which they give rise. Yet regulation is not easy: democracies worry about the abridgment of free speech; while these Digital Giants are global, standards, market effects, and values are national and local. Are they too big, too complex, and too dynamic to regulate, with any such attempts threatening innovation? While the United States has yet to introduce new laws, Europe, Australia and China have forged ahead, with quite different models. The conversation will discuss  the Center on Regulation in Europe’s (CERRE) report on prospects and frameworks for tech regulation and consider  the global applicability of a broadened version of that framework.

Weinstein Director, CJEB; Carl S. Shoup Professor of the Japanese Economy, Columbia UniversityTopics to be covered: •	Japan’s adland: As the world’s third-largest advertising market, what is the state of Japan’s industry? What are the challenges and opportunities vs. other global markets? What tools and practices should marketers in Japan be adopting, and how do they stand to benefit from these? Can WPP deliver on these? •	Global technological development and the need to remain humanely creative: With the rise of new AI tools like ChatGPT, the evolution of Virtual Idols and the Metaverse, some say that creatives stand to lose their jobs, or that at the very least, their jobs will look different. What risks do these tools bring? How do these tools impact personalization? Is that something we are moving towards or away from in advertising? Ms. Matsushita will share her perspective.•	Repercussions for Japan’s creative industry: Are these tools the solution Japanese marketers need to catch up and digitalize? Are they input or output tools? Is there a need for human creatives anymore? How can these new tools be used creatively to benefit wider society in Japan and across the globe?   About the speaker:Kyoko Matsushita assumed her role as Chief Executive Officer of WPP in Japan in April 2022 to oversee its agencies in Japan ― AKQA, BCW, Geometry Ogilvy, Grey, GroupM, Hogarth, Landor & Fitch, VMLY&R, and Wunderman Thompson ― and strengthen collective capabilities of the entire group.

However, existing approaches are computationally expensive at high resolution, fundamentally hindering real-time decision making in science and engineering. While deep learning has shown tremendous promise in accelerating simulations, it remains a grand challenge to incorporate physical principles in a systematic manner into the design and training of such models. In this talk, I will demonstrate how to principally incorporate physics in deep learning models to accelerate simulations and assist decision-making. I will showcase the applications of these models to challenging problems in climate science and infectious disease modeling.Bio: Dr. Rose Yu is an assistant professor at the University of California San Diego, Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Her research focuses on advancing machine learning techniques for large-scale spatiotemporal data analysis, with applications to sustainability, health, and physical sciences. A particular emphasis of her research is on physics-guided AI which aims to integrate first principles with data-driven models. Among her awards, she has won NSF CAREER Award, several Faculty Research Award, Best Paper Awards, Best Dissertation Award at USC, and was nominated as one of the ’MIT Rising Stars in EECS’.Learn More: LEAP ROSE YU (UCSD)","LEAP Center","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/leap-center-45565168003"
