The nexus concept has allowed academics and other resources practitioners to express the interdependencies and constraints between these three systems, and to offer solutions that bridge across them. We are entering a new era of addressing nexus problems — applying remote monitoring, analytics, AI, and machine learning to water sustainability is unearthing new insights and solutions. The open data revolution has given access to organizations that would not be able to gather and process data themselves.In this session, experts from Accenture, Deltares, Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Google, Microsoft, Water Resources Management Authority in Zambia, World Wildlife Fund, and World Resources Institute will discuss the role of advanced technology and multi-sectoral collaboration in addressing nexus issues, and provide a deep dive into the Global Water Watch platform with a chance for the audience to provide feedback on this tool. Global Water Watch, supported by Google and the Water, Peace, and Security Partnership, is a data platform of free, globally accessible near-real-time information on water. It provides information on thousands of global reservoirs, helping decision-makers respond to extreme weather events and managing growing risks of climate change. The platform uses modern AI and EO algorithms to map dams and produce high-resolution spatiotemporal information on the amount of water stored in reservoirs in near-real-time.A﻿ccess the webcast.P﻿anelists and SpeakersElizabeth Burlon, Global Solution Development Lead for Water Sustainability and Energy Efficiency, AccentureDr. A.M.

We leverage administrative data collected in deployment to design an online policy that maximizes mean outcomes while satisfying budget and fairness requirements. We propose a policy in which an individual receives the resource maximizing the difference between their mean treatment outcomes and the resource bid price, or roughly the opportunity cost of using a resource. Our approach has nice asymptotic guarantees and is easily interpretable. We show results on real data from the Homeless Management Information System in LA: our policies improve rates of exit from homelessness by 1.2% and policies that are fair in either allocation or outcomes by race come at very low price of fairness. In addition, to help guide the discussion among stakeholders in deciding on appropriate fairness requirements to impose when allocating scarce resources,  we propose a framework for evaluating fairness in such resource allocation systems and present a set of incompatibility results that investigate the interplay between them. Notably, we show that 1) fairness in allocation and fairness in outcomes are usually incompatible; 2) policies that prioritize based on a vulnerability score will usually result in unequal outcomes across groups; and 3) policies using group membership in addition to baseline risk and treatment effects are as fair as possible given all available information.BIOPhebe Vayanos is a WiSE Gabilan Assistant Professor of Industrial & Systems Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Southern California.

While the past three decades have seen IWRM having a profound impact on water planning practices, it has not yet yielded sustainable water outcomes. The results can inadvertently create conflict, exclude critical users, or ignore gaps in water management. As highlighted across the SDGs, key gaps in sustainable and equitable water access require looking at what happens beyond the watershed, thinking about inclusive participatory approaches, climate-oriented actions, the macroeconomic impacts around water, and consideration for ecosystems.To address these gaps, we have invited panelists from different geographies and professional backgrounds, from the local to the government level, to share their experiences and best practices, and discuss what could be our joint next steps to fulfill the Water Action Agenda. Focused on innovation from a cross-sector and a multi-country perspective, our panelists will be discussing the following action points:1. Action to foster cooperation and collaboration: Sustainable water management should reach beyond the watershed, with participatory processes based not only on one location. For this, we need to consider cross-sectoral and macroeconomic implications and decision-making outside the watershed.2. Action to maintain ecosystem health and implement the source-to-sea approach: Ecosystems should be considered throughout the water management and planning process. For this, we need approaches that incorporate ecosystem needs and processes as well as source-to-sea management. 3. Action to increase knowledge sharing and inclusive decision making: Collaborative and inclusive engagement in water management delivers more effective long-term outcomes. For this, we need to enable policymakers to see not only watershed-wide water demand and supply, but also smaller-scale differences that illuminate inequalities, addressing issues of poverty, gender, and inclusion of marginalized groups.P﻿lease note that this Side Event will be inside the UN Headquarters.

The talk will center on the recently published A History of Irish Literature and the Environment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2022). From Gaelic annals and medieval poetry to contemporary Irish literature, A History of Irish Literature and the Environment examines the connections between the Irish environment and Irish literary culture. Tackling themes such as Ireland’s island ecology, the ecological history of colonial-era plantation and deforestation, the Great Famine, cultural attitudes towards animals and towards the land, the postcolonial politics of food and energy generation, and the Covid-19 pandemic. Sen will demonstrate how these factors not only guide us to fresh perspectives on Irish literature but also provide pathways to imagine habitable futures at a time of climate collapse.  

Malcolm Sen is an Associate Professor at UMass Amherst and directs the Environmental Humanities specialization offered by the Department of English. His research focuses on questions of sovereignty, migration, and race as they emerge in climate change discourse. His literary archive spans global Anglophone, Indian, and Irish literatures. He is the co-editor of Postcolonial Studies and Challenges of the New Millennium (Routledge, 2016). He is the editor of The History of Irish Literature and the Environment (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2022); and Race in Irish Literature and Culture (with Julie McCormick Weng) to be published by Cambridge University Press in 2023. Sen’s monograph Unnatural Disasters: Irish Literature, Climate Change and Sovereignty is under review.

In between, monsoon rains support grasslands and savannahs, and the livelihoods of farmers and herders. Local practices have evolved to manage the large spatial and seasonal variations in rainfall, but droughts and floods are common and devastating, and are likely to get worse.Planning a development pathway that is resilient to climate requires understanding both the expected range of climatic conditions and how climate affects people's choices. We present two early-stage projects that address the link between drought and the movement of people in the present and the past. The common thread is a preliminary, centuries-long, tree-ring-based drought atlas. The atlas provides (i) an observational-based estimate of natural variations in drought severity to use in games assessing the adaptation strategies of transhumant herders, and (ii) a history of drought patterns that can be compared to population-level migrations in pre-colonial times to compare the effects of environmental pressures against other societal drivers.These projects are still getting off the ground, and we will openly discuss the challenges deriving from disciplinary barriers in language and methods and from the limitations of the drought atlas itself.E﻿vent SpeakersMichela Biasutti, Lamont Associate Research Professor at Columbia UniversityBoniface Fosu, Assistant Professor of Meteorology and Climate Sciences at Mississippi State UniversityEvent InformationFree and open to Columbia University ID holders; registration required.  Part of the History and Climate Change workshop series hosted by the Environmental Sciences and Humanities Research Cluster at the Center for Science and Society and co-funded by the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy.

As the next expansion of our events platform, we are thrilled to introduce our inaugural Wavelengths Summit — our flagship conference on what’s next in music and tech, which will take place on May 6, 2023 in Bushwick, Brooklyn.Our thesisOur mission as an organization is to make the music industry more innovative, cooperative, and transparent. We accomplish this through a social, peer-to-peer approach to sharing knowledge and best practices for industry innovation.The Wavelengths Summit will be an IRL extension of this mission — fostering community among the next generation of music-tech leaders, creators, and innovators through culture, conversation, and collaboration.In a noisy tech landscape, we see more demand from music-industry professionals for a more focused environment to build community, exchange ideas, and bring new products to life. With emerging tech trends in particular, there’s a critical need for a forum that bridges the early-adopter perspective with a clear pulse on traditional industry needs, to establish a shared understanding of the issues at stake.The experienceWHO: The inaugural Wavelengths Summit is for artists, founders, dealmakers, and innovators — within the Water & Music Community, or yet to be a part of it.WHERE: Our inaugural summit will call Brooklyn home — more specifically, Bushwick, a mainstay  center for culture, music, and technology for New York City, and in turn for the world. It is home to iconic venues like Elsewhere, Brooklyn Mirage, Nowadays, House of Yes, and more.WHAT: The Wavelengths Summit will focus on what we feel we do best at Water & Music: Creating space for thoughtful discussion, community-building and experimental collaboration. Instead of panels, we will design the summit around more interactive, multi-way programming that showcases the experience and ingenuity of our members — with a focus on ROUNDTABLES, WORKSHOPS and DEBATES.We are honing in on three overarching themes and topics for the Summit. We see each of these broader topics as important interests and priorities for our community, and for the broader music-tech industry at large. Programming will be distributed evenly among these topics.Emerging Tech (e.c. AI, Web3, Metaverse)Fandom + Community (e.c. Artists + fans, DAOs)Bridging Legacy Systems (i.g. streaming, music rights)We are also excited to be partnering with Refraction for Cultural Programming – stay tuned for more details!Frequently asked questionsIs there a refund policy for registration fees?What is the schedule for the day?Is there a hotel or accommodation near the conference venue?Will Wavelengths Summit be live-streamed or recorded for later viewing?","Water & Music","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/water-amp-music-62205027333"

In the panel discussion, speakers unpack the concept of “eco-affinity” which essentially translates into a love of nature or a sense of “being nature” that becomes naturally embodied as a result of deep contemplative and faith-based practice, especially in nature settings. Panelists provide examples of this, such as Be Nature retreats or mindful beach clean-ups by AHAM Education and partners, compassionate eco-action through volunteerism and service by Tzu Chi Foundation, or the cultivation of kindness to nature as oneself by the Brahmakumaris. Ultimately, the call to action here is to embrace a new paradigm of activism. Rather than fear-based and anxiety-producing approaches to facing water and climate challenges, we can choose to rebuild affinity with nature and water to catalyze healing and motivate positive eco-transformation for people and planet.

Gender, Mobility and Climate Changes in India and RomaniaHow are women from vulnerable communities, impacted by the axis of environmental disasters and patterns of mobility? Addressing this question, the talk presents the findings from ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Roșia Montană (Transylvania), Romania and West Bengal (Sunderban Delta), India. Integrating political ethnography conducted primarily with women and visual analysis, this work assesses patterns of movement within communities affected by complex environmental changes. In doing so, it showcases who moves, who stays, how decisions are made, and how they impact women and girls facing environmental changes. A﻿bout the speakerCristina-Ioana Dragomir is a Clinical Assistant Professor in Global Liberal Studies at New York University, member of the Politics Rights and Development and Sustainably, Health and Environment concentrations. As a professor and scholar, Dragomir has taught and researched social justice, migration, and the relationship between gender and the environment at several universities, including Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, State University of New York, and Queen Mary University of London. She also consults with the United Nations, GIZ, IUCN Commission on Environmental, Economic & Social Policy, and IOM. Interrogating mobility in the context of the current climate crises, her work looks at mobility as a complex process, that not only engages those who have to move due to the environmental changes, but those who are forced to stay, especially women and girls, and who are left to carry the burden of continuing to care for their communities, surviving through environmental disasters, while often lacking support from migrating partners. **N﻿YU CUSP Research Seminars are only open to faculty, students, and staff at NYU – they are not open to the public at this time.**","NYU Center for Urban Science + Progress","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/nyu-center-for-urban-science-progress-61585017433"

We aim to highlight engagements from cities, Governments, youth movement and private sector that can enable water wise and climate smart urban environments. This session will build on insights from the report “The essential drop to Net-Zero: Unpacking freshwater’s role in climate change mitigation”. For over two years, SIWI and partner organizations have reviewed available scientific knowledge about the role of freshwater in climate mitigation, including aspects like energy, wastewater treatment and nature-based solutions. This pioneering work shows that water-wise climate action can be a make-or-break factor for mitigating global warming.  The report highlights how freshwater is key in reaching the Paris Agreement overarching goal to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and pursuing efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.  In this side event, we aim to explore how cities can design strategies in line with the best available scientific knowledge. The discussion will also delve into the transformative role of youth engagement in mobilizing progress towards achieving the SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).  The event will offer a multi-level governance view on solutions to the fragmented nature of global water governance in ways that create synergies and avoid negative trade-offs. The event aims to: 1) Share different knowledge and experiences on how cities can strengthen activities and commitments on water solutions that can provide multiple benefits for both climate mitigation and adaptation and a just transition and blue economy. 2) Build on youth expertise and engagement on progress for water and climate commitments.3) Create a basis for increased cross-sectorial commitments to further strengthen collective action on Water – and Climate Action Agenda ahead of COP28.","SIWI","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/siwi-62801050493"

It aims to bring together scientists and social scientists to help look through the lens of historical pasts, politics, and embedded presents. Devastation and displacement from water caused by the climate crisis are and will remain a recurring, returning, and pervasive phenomenon in the global south. This approach intends to shift away from the focus on modeling catastrophic futures, the periodization of eras, and mapping the implications of climate change that prevail in current dialogues on climate change. Rather, the workshop guides towards a conversation that foregrounds human and environmental vulnerability in non-Western, transnational spaces with Indigenous and historical means of resilience. The intention is to continue this series with a focus on Air and Land in the following academic year.Event SpeakersSunil Amrith, Renu and Anand Dhawan Professor of History at Yale UniversityAmita Baviskar, Professor of Environmental Studies and Sociology and Anthropology at Ashoka UniversityKarine Gagné, Associate Professor of Sociology and Anthropology at the University of GuelphMaira Hayat, Assistant Professor of Environment and Peace Studies at the University of Notre DameMarvi Mazhar, architect and researcherHung T.

While the past three decades have seen IWRM having a profound impact on water planning practices, it has not yet yielded sustainable water outcomes. The results can inadvertently create conflict, exclude critical users, or ignore gaps in water management. As highlighted across the SDGs, key gaps in sustainable and equitable water access require looking at what happens beyond the watershed, thinking about inclusive participatory approaches, climate-oriented actions, the macroeconomic impacts around water, and consideration for ecosystems.To address these gaps, we have invited panelists from different geographies and professional backgrounds, from the local to the government level, to share their experiences and best practices, and discuss what could be our joint next steps to fulfill the Water Action Agenda. Focused on innovation from a cross-sector and a multi-country perspective, our panelists will be discussing the following action points:1. Foster collaboration beyond the watershed: Sustainable water management should reach beyond the watershed, with participatory processes based not only on one location. To foster cooperation, the global community will need to consider the economies bound to the watershed on any side of a given border.2. Maintain ecosystem health and implement the source-to-sea approach: Ecosystems should be considered throughout the water management and planning process. For this, we need approaches that incorporate ecosystem needs and processes as well as a source-to-sea approach that recognizes the links between land, freshwater and the ocean. 3. Increase knowledge sharing and inclusive decision making: Collaborative and inclusive engagement in water management delivers more effective long-term outcomes. For this, we need to enable policymakers to see not only watershed-wide water demand and supply, but also smaller-scale differences that illuminate inequalities, addressing issues of poverty, gender, and inclusion of marginalized groups.P﻿anel DiscussionOur invited panelists are committed to achieving SDG 6 and have partnered with SEI in previous and ongoing initiatives, such as Bolivia WATCH (WASH Thinking Connected to Hydrology, applied to three priority river basins in Bolivia—Upper La Paz, Pampa-Huari and Tupiza), Water Beyond Boundaries (with case studies in Colombia’s Magdalena-Cauca River basin and Thailand’s Lower Songkhram River, a tributary of the Mekong River), Rwanda’s hydro-economic and climate change analysis (HECCA) supported by the World Bank, USAID Regional Water and Vulnerable Environment Activity in Central Asia, SEI's Strategy for the Ocean and Biodiversity, and ecosystem consideration in water planning and management in California.

Risk managers, brokers, and carriers all must find ways to share data about risk, assets, and claims in a way that maintains a stable value chain.InsurTechs introduce an entirely new form of collaboration into the industry. Collaboration is necessary for survival to new InsurTech distributors. Most InsurTechs are not capitalized enough to become carriers at inception, so they rely on carriers to lend their licenses, balance sheet, and reinsurance capacity to get them started. Similarly, InsurTech solution providers rely on carriers and brokers to purchase and integrate their software into an existing value chain.Therefore, we decided to bring together the legacy and emerging insurance industry players together to talk about what is necessary to build better collaboration across the value chain. This conference will be divided into two tracks: (1) Life and Health and (2) Property and Casualty. The conference will also host the largest InsurTech competition on the East Coast.  Top startups from a pool of 100+ applicants will pitch in front of investors and insurance executives.

The Digital Giants have become a source of global concern, both because of their market power and the “digital harms” to which they give rise. Yet regulation is not easy: democracies worry about the abridgment of free speech; while these Digital Giants are global, standards, market effects, and values are national and local. Are they too big, too complex, and too dynamic to regulate, with any such attempts threatening innovation? While the United States has yet to introduce new laws, Europe, Australia and China have forged ahead, with quite different models. The conversation will discuss  the Center on Regulation in Europe’s (CERRE) report on prospects and frameworks for tech regulation and consider  the global applicability of a broadened version of that framework.

Today there are over 88+ mainstream annual conferences for space experts and potential enthusiasts. Yet as space becomes a more relevant part of our future reality- the ecosystem continues to gather only space experts, astronauts and researchers. Space Tech Summit asks- what happens when we invite the creatives, entrepreneurs, authors, actors, athletes and other ecosystem builders of society to the ""future of space"" conversation?In 2018 the theme focused on “The Future Exploration and Commercialization of Space'' with an analysis of ecosystem influencers that drives the space industry to new heights such as startups, SME's and enterprises, VC funds, angel investors, research think tanks, governments and corporate innovators. In 2019, for the 50th Anniversary of the Moon Landing, the theme focused on “Lessons of 50 Years of Space Race History and What it Means for Humanity’s Future”. In 2020, during the pandemic year, Space Tech Summit convened micro virtual roundtables on how space technology can impact global grand challenges. The 2021 theme is “From Space Travel to Space Cities - The New Era of the Space Tech Movement” where there will be a heavy dialogue on influencers who are driving the space race to make humans a multi planetary species by 2050. The summit will also highlight sub themes like “A Look at How to Relocate to Space in the Future” , “How startups can disrupt the future of space” and “The Current Applications of Space Technologies on Earth”.

Weinstein Director, CJEB; Carl S. Shoup Professor of the Japanese Economy, Columbia UniversityTopics to be covered: •	Japan’s adland: As the world’s third-largest advertising market, what is the state of Japan’s industry? What are the challenges and opportunities vs. other global markets? What tools and practices should marketers in Japan be adopting, and how do they stand to benefit from these? Can WPP deliver on these? •	Global technological development and the need to remain humanely creative: With the rise of new AI tools like ChatGPT, the evolution of Virtual Idols and the Metaverse, some say that creatives stand to lose their jobs, or that at the very least, their jobs will look different. What risks do these tools bring? How do these tools impact personalization? Is that something we are moving towards or away from in advertising? Ms. Matsushita will share her perspective.•	Repercussions for Japan’s creative industry: Are these tools the solution Japanese marketers need to catch up and digitalize? Are they input or output tools? Is there a need for human creatives anymore? How can these new tools be used creatively to benefit wider society in Japan and across the globe?   About the speaker:Kyoko Matsushita assumed her role as Chief Executive Officer of WPP in Japan in April 2022 to oversee its agencies in Japan ― AKQA, BCW, Geometry Ogilvy, Grey, GroupM, Hogarth, Landor & Fitch, VMLY&R, and Wunderman Thompson ― and strengthen collective capabilities of the entire group.

However, existing approaches are computationally expensive at high resolution, fundamentally hindering real-time decision making in science and engineering. While deep learning has shown tremendous promise in accelerating simulations, it remains a grand challenge to incorporate physical principles in a systematic manner into the design and training of such models. In this talk, I will demonstrate how to principally incorporate physics in deep learning models to accelerate simulations and assist decision-making. I will showcase the applications of these models to challenging problems in climate science and infectious disease modeling.Bio: Dr. Rose Yu is an assistant professor at the University of California San Diego, Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

Lobel argues that while we cannot stop technological development, we can direct its course according to our most fundamental values. Lobel explains that digital technology frequently has a comparative advantage over humans in detecting discrimination, correcting historical exclusions, subverting long-standing stereotypes, and addressing the world’s thorniest problems: climate, poverty, injustice, literacy, accessibility, speech, health, and safety.

This workshop will focus on tantric breathwork. Stemming from ancient Hindu and Buddhist practices, tantric breathwork consists of specialized breathing exercises designed to harness the creative powers of human sexual energy, thus activating our highest powers of manifestation. Mariane's sessions are curated to release your natural DMT, a powerful psychedelic chemical produced in the brainstem and released during dreamstates and deep meditation. This release causes intense feelings of euphoria, relaxation, and spiritual transcendence. The psychedelic state induced by tantric breathwork lowers the barriers so often put in place by the ego that can block people from exercising their full spiritual power.March's workshop will be held during the convergence of the Spring Equinox and the New Moon in Aries, a time period that will ignite collective energies of passion, abundance, and new beginnings. To celebrate the Astrological New Year and the bloom of the new season, this workshop will be charged with the intention to inspire rapid personal growth and creativity in order to invite new levels of spiritual and material wealth.The workshop will open with a shamanic tea ceremony. During the breathwork session, versatile instrumentalist Jeffrey Conners @panoramix_musica will offer the sound medicine of live drumming, flute, and guitar. Mariane will close with a guided journaling session to help participants integrate the experiences and downloads from the workshop into their daily lives.Expect to go home feeling renewed, inspired, and ready to dive into the next phase of your ascension. Sound healing, divination, and massage will also be offered.","Mariane Sakay","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/mariane-sakay-40908568393"

This is a private tour for members and non-members followed by light bites. After party venue TBD. All proceeds will be donated to the Climate Museum.Total of 20 spots available.About the Climate Museum: Contending with the climate crisis at scale requires a transformation of our public culture. The Climate Museum mobilizes the power of arts and cultural programming to accelerate this crucial shift toward climate dialogue and action, connecting people and advancing just solutions. The popularity and trust held by museums help us bring people together to learn and to join the fight for a brighter future through pathways that include interdisciplinary exhibitions, art installations, interactive panels, performances, science events, youth programs, and more. There is a bipartisan American supermajority that supports bold climate policy — but it is a supermajority yet to be activated. While two thirds of us want to see sweeping changes and progress, we so dramatically misperceive climate sentiment that we believe two thirds of us are opposed to these policies.The researchers who recently identified this gap between what we perceive and the truth call it a “false social reality.” The ubiquitous misperception of American indifference on climate creates a spiral of silence and passivity, which the Museum counters with inclusive, equity-centered programming that helps people turn away from resignation toward their own courage, connectedness, and agency. Our visitors emphatically express the value of this work.","NYC Fair Trade Coalition","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/nyc-fair-trade-coalition-12061358612"
